<h3>Marjor.am is a Game Management System</h3>

<p>Marjor.am is a framework for building game servers. Inspired by content management systems (CMSs) like Wordpress and Drupal, Marjor.am aims to make setting up networking for your game much easier. </p>

<h3>Marjor.am is Modular</h3>

<p>While there is a default configuration we try to keep everything as modular as possible. We do this for two reasons. The first is for ease of development, as long as the internal interfaces stay the same we can work on each module as we see fit without disturbing the others. </p>

<p>The second is customization. We see Marjor.am as being a powerful framework for game developers, but we couldn't possibly anticipate every need of every game developer, so instead we made it as easy as possible to get up and running with as little custom code as possible. You may need to write a leaf to handle your "cyberpunk-wordgame-meets-baseball-sim" but you shouldn't need to touch any of Marjor.am's core. </p>

<h3>Marjor.am is Light Weight</h3>

<p>If you are looking to build the next World of EveCraft Online, this is probably not the framework for you. If you want to add profiles and a global high-score to your puzzle game, you are in the right place. </p>

<p>Marjor.am might be a good fit for your project if you need:</p>

<ul>
<li>asynchronous communication (Marjor.am is not optimized for realtime) </li>
<li>low volume of data (Marjor.am is designed to run on basic webhosting) </li>
<li>simple data storage (think strings and numbers)</li>
</ul><p>If that sounds like your project welcome to Marjor.am.</p>

<h3>Marjor.am is Open Source</h3>

<p>Feel free to dig in and take a look around.</p>
